    "As its name implies, a recommender system is a tool that helps predicting what a user may or may not like among a list of given items. In some sense, you can view this as an alternative to content search, as recommendation engines help users discover products or content that they may not come across otherwise. For example, Facebook suggests friends and pages to users. Youtube recommends videos which users may be interested in. Amazon suggests the products which users may need... Recommendation engines engage users to services, can be seen as a revenue optimization process, and in general help maintaining interest in a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we study how to build a simple recommender system: we focus on music recommendations, and we use a simple algorithm to predict which items users might like, that is called ALS, alternating least squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we expect students to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Revisit (or learn) recommender algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the idea of Matrix Factorization and the ALS algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a simple model for a real usecase: music recommender system\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to validate the results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume students to work outside lab hours on the learning material. These are the steps by which we guide students, during labs, to build a good basis for the end-to-end development of a recommender system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inspect the data using Pandas, and build some basic, but very valuable knowledge about the information we have at hand\n",
    "* Formally define what is a sensible algorithm to achieve our goal: given the \"history\" of user taste for music, recommend new music to discover. Essentialy, we want to build a statistical model of user preferences such that we can use it to \"predict\" which additional music the user could like\n",
    "* With our formal definition at hand, we will learn different ways to implement such an algorithm. Our goal here is to illustrate what are the difficulties to overcome when implementing an algorithm like Matrix Factorization\n",
    "* Finally, we will focus on an existing implementation, available in ```Implicit```, which we will use out of the box to build a reliable statistical model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may think at this point we will be done!\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you'd better think twice: one important topic we will cover in all our Notebooks is **how to validate the results we obtain**, and **how to choose good parameters to train models** especially when using an \"opaque\" library for doing the job. As a consequence, we will focus on the statistical validation of our recommender system.\n"

    "# 1. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding data is one of the most important part when designing any machine learning algorithm. In this notebook, we will use a data set published by Audioscrobbler - a music recommendation system for last.fm. Audioscrobbler is also one of the first internet streaming radio sites, founded in 2002. It provided an open API for scrobbling, or recording listeners' plays of artists' songs. last.fm used this information to build a powerful music recommender engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Data schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a rating dataset which contains information about users' preference for products (one star, 3 stars, and so on), the datasets from Audioscrobbler only has information about events: specifically, it keeps track of how many times a user played songs of a given artist and the names of artists. That means it carries less information than a rating: in the literature, this is called explicit vs. implicit ratings.\n",

    "* How many play counts for each artist? This is a good indicator of the artist popularity. Since we do not have time information associated to our data, we can only build a, e.g., top-10 ranking of the most popular artists in the dataset. Later in the notebook, we will learn that our dataset has a very \"loose\" definition about artists: very often artist IDs point to song titles as well. This means we have to be careful when establishing popular artists. Indeed, artists whose data is \"well formed\" will have the correct number of play counts associated to them. Instead, artists that appear mixed with song titles may see their play counts \"diluted\" across their songs."

    "The obtained plot shows a <b>commulative distribution graph</b> for the <b>play count per user</b>. We hereby focus on <b>5</b> different percentiles (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%) and we can extract the following observations:<br>\n",
    "* 10% of userID's have played music about 34 times or less.<br>\n",
    "* 25% of userID's have played music about 204 times or less.<br>\n",
    "* 50% of userID's have played music about 892 times or less (<b>Median</b>).<br>\n",
    "* 75% of userID's have played music about 2800 times or less.<br>\n",
    "* 90% of userID's have played music about 6484 times or less.<br>\n",
    "This shows us that generally tehre is a strong overall interaction with the system as more than half the users actually have played music more than a <b>thousand</b> times. This means that recommending music for this majority of the users should be easy because they have provided a rich <b>implicit feedback</b> to the system. Such users may have up to  On the contrary, some users do not have this property where 10% of the total population just above 30 songs or less. The latter will make it more difficult to recommend music for them because we haven't collected a large amount of implicit feedback.<br> The users that have a high play count may reach 674412 plays. On the other hand, there are also users that have only one play count value. Such kind of outliers (having very low counts) can either be bots or just one-time users and cannot benifit from the potential of the recommender system.\n",

    "The plot above shows the <b>commulative distribution function</b> of the <b>play counts per artist ID</b>. This plot has a different shape from the one studying the user activity. Before going to the analysis of the result, lets extract the numerical data:<br>\n",
    "* 10% of artistID's have played music about 1 time or less.<br>\n",
    "* 25% of artistID's have played music about 1 time or less.<br>\n",
    "* 50% of artistID's have played music about 3 times or less (<b>Median</b>).<br>\n",
    "* 75% of artistID's have played music about 11 times or less.<br>\n",
    "* 90% of artistID's have played music about 45 times or less.<br>\n",
    "We can easily conclude that the data is <b>skewed</b> towards the lower playcount side which actually draws suspicion. And this begs the question: <b>\"can 90% of all artist actually have less than 45 plays?!\"</b> Well this is highly unlikely. But as mentioned before in <b>Question 1</b> regarding the fact that serveral artistID's may correspond to the same artist (artistID's may correspond to a song or a typo in the name of the artist) is emphasized in the plot obtained, since we have a huge portion of artistID (more than 90%) having very low play records. Thus, these artistID are most likely to represent typos and songs and hence the data we currently have is heavily diluted and hides the actual characteristics and statistics of the performance and popularity of artists on the system.<br>\n",
    "<b>NOTE</b>: it is also important to point out that we have more than <b>1.6 million artist IDs</b> where only <b>163 K</b> have more than 45 play record.\n",

    "The above plot shows the top 10 artistID's with respect to the play count. This is, to an extent, an indicator of the artist's popularity. Without any assumption about the <b>uniqueness</b> of the artist IDs, the obtained results are very reasonable as the top 10 artists have high play records ranging from <b>1 million to 2.5 million plays</b>.<br>However, merely looking at the top 10 does not give us enough information about the data. Therefore, we also plotted the bottom 10 artists and we noticed again something stange which is that all of the bottom 10 artists have a play count of <b>1</b>. This emphasized what we saw in the second CDF, which is the fact that actually unique artists may be scattered over several artistID's which is causing the play counts to be <b>diluted</b>.<br>\n",

    "After displaying the top 10 artists in terms of the audience size, we can see than they are actually different from the top 10 artists with respect to absolute play counts. Hence, the <b>popularity invesitgation</b> is dependent on how we deal with it; whether its through play counts or through audience size. For example, <b>Coldplay</b> did not appear in the top 10 artist play counts but has appeared here. Thus, it has been important to differentiate between the <b>total play count</b> and the <b>audience size</b> in the same way that notebook previously discusses the difference between the <b>curiousity of the user</b> and his/her <b>absolute play count</b> because we cannot conclude one from the others. The reason is due to the fact that many users actually play tracks for a single artists a massive number of times which leads to a difference between the two aproaches.\n",

    "# 2. Build a statistical models to make recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Introduction to recommender systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recommendation-system application there are two classes of entities, which we shall refer to as `users` and `items`. Users have preferences for certain items, and these preferences must be inferred from the data. The data itself is represented as a `preference matrix` $A$, giving for each user-item pair, a value that represents what is known about the degree of preference of that user for that item. The table below is an example for a `preference matrix` of 5 users and `k` items. The `preference matrix` is also known as `utility matrix`.\n",
    "\n",
    "| .  | IT1 | IT2 | IT3 | ... | ITk |\n",
    "|----|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| U1 | 1 | na | 5 | ... | 3 |\n",
    "| U2 | na | 2 | na | ... | 2 |\n",
    "| U3 | 5 | na | 3 | ... | na |\n",
    "| U4 | 3 | 3 | na | ... | 4 |\n",
    "| U5 | na | 1 | na | ... | ... |\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of row i, column j expresses how much does user `i` like item `j`. The values are often the rating scores of users for items. An unknown value implies that we have no explicit information about the user's preference for the item. The goal of a recommendation system is to predict \"the blanks\" in the `preference matrix`. For example, assume that the rating score is from 1 (dislike) to 5 (love), would user `U5` like `IT3` ? We have two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Designing our recommendation system to take into account properties of items such as brand, category, price... or even the similarity of their names. We can denote the similarity of items `IT2` and `IT3`, and then conclude that because user `U5` did not like `IT2`, they were unlikely to enjoy SW2 either.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We might observe that the people who rated both `IT2` and `IT3` tended to give them similar ratings. Thus, we could conclude that user `U5` would also give `IT3` a low rating, similar to `U5`'s rating of `IT2`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not necessary to predict every blank entry in a `utility matrix`. Rather, it is only necessary to discover some entries in each row that are likely to be high. In most applications, the recommendation system does not oﬀer users a ranking of all items, but rather suggests a few that the user should value highly. It may not even be necessary to ﬁnd all items with the highest expected ratings, but only to ﬁnd a large subset of those with the highest ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Families of recommender systems\n",

    "In general, recommender systems can be categorized into two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Content-Based** systems focus on properties of items. Similarity of items is determined by measuring the similarity in their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Collaborative-Filtering** systems focus on the relationship between users and items. Similarity of items is determined by the similarity of the ratings of those items by the users who have rated both items.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the usecase of this notebook, artists take the role of `items`, and `users` keep the same role as `users`.\n",
    "Since we have no information about `artists`, except their names, we cannot build a `content-based` recommender system.\n",

    "## 2.3 Collaborative-Filtering \n",
    "In this section, we study a member of a broad class of algorithms called `latent-factor` models. They try to explain observed interactions between large numbers of users and products through a relatively small number of unobserved, underlying reasons. It is analogous to explaining why millions of people buy a particular few of thousands of possible albums by describing users and albums in terms of tastes for perhaps tens of genres, tastes which are **not directly observable or given** as data. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we formulate the learning problem as a matrix completion problem. Then, we will use a type of `matrix factorization` model to \"fill in\" the blanks.  We are given implicit ratings that users have given certain items (that is, the number of times they played a particular artist) and our goal is to predict their ratings for the rest of the items. Formally, if there are $n$ users and $m$ items, we are given an $n \\times m$ matrix $R$ in which the generic entry $(u, i)$ represents the rating for item $i$ by user $u$. **Matrix $R$ has many missing entries indicating unobserved ratings, and our task is to estimate these unobserved ratings**.\n",

    "## 3.5 Evaluating Recommendation Quality \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we study how to evaluate the quality of our model. It's hard to say how good the recommendations are.\n",
    "One of serveral methods approach to evaluate  a recommender based on its ability to rank good items (artists) high in a list of recommendations. The problem is how to define \"good artists\". Currently, by training all data, \"good artists\" is defined as \"artists the user has listened to\", and the recommender system has already received all of this information as input. It could trivially return the users previously-listened artists as top recommendations and score perfectly. Indeed, this is not useful, because the recommender's is used to recommend artists that the user has **never** listened to. \n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome that problem, we can hide the some of the artist play data and only use the rest to train model. Then, this held-out data can be interpreted as a collection of \"good\" recommendations for each user. The recommender is asked to rank all items in the model, and the rank of the held-out artists are examined. Ideally the recommender places all of them at or near the top of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommender's score can then be computed by comparing all held-out artists' ranks to the rest.  The fraction of pairs where the held-out artist is ranked higher is its score. 1.0 is perfect, 0.0 is the worst possible score, and 0.5 is the expected value achieved from randomly ranking artists. \n",
    "\n",
    "AUC(Area Under the Curve) can be used as a metric to evaluate model. It is also viewed as the probability that a randomly-chosen \"good\" artist ranks above a randomly-chosen \"bad\" artist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we split the training data into 2 parts: `trainData` and `cvData` with ratio 0.9:0.1 respectively, where `trainData` is the dataset that will be used to train model. Then we write a function to calculate AUC to evaluate the quality of our model.\n"

The following parameters should get consideration before training models:\n",

Instead of runing the algorithm until RMSE converged which actually takes very long time to finish with large datasets, we only let it run in a given number of iterations. More iterations take more time but may produce a better factorization.\n",
